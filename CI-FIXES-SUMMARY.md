# CI Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Path Inconsistencies âœ…
**Problem**: Workflows referenced `fuego-tauri` subdirectory that doesn't exist
**Fix**: Removed all `working-directory: fuego-tauri` references and updated paths to use correct structure

### 2. Ubuntu Dependencies âœ…
**Problem**: Using outdated `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` package
**Fix**: Updated to `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` and added essential build tools:
- `build-essential`
- `curl`
- `wget` 
- `file`
- `patchelf`

### 3. Rust Build Environment âœ…
**Problem**: Missing `Cargo.lock` file causing inconsistent builds
**Fix**: Generated `Cargo.lock` file for reproducible builds

### 4. Cache Path Issues âœ…
**Problem**: Wrong target directory paths in CI caching
**Fix**: Updated cache paths from `fuego-tauri/src-tauri/target/` to `src-tauri/target/`

## Files Modified

### Workflow Files
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI workflow
- `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` - Release workflow
- `.github/workflows/test-build.yml` - New test workflow (added)

### Scripts Added
- `scripts/ci-monitor.sh` - Automated CI monitoring and fix application
- `scripts/check-ci-status.sh` - Simple status checker

### Build Files
- `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` - Generated for reproducible builds

## How to Use the Monitoring Tools

### Quick Status Check
```bash
./scripts/check-ci-status.sh
```
This will show you the current status of all CI builds for the latest commit.

### Automated Monitoring and Fixing
```bash
./scripts/ci-monitor.sh
```
This script will:
1. Monitor CI builds continuously
2. Download and analyze logs when builds fail
3. Identify common issues automatically
4. Apply fixes and commit them
5. Wait for new builds and repeat until all are green

### Manual Build Test
```bash
# Test frontend build
npm run build

# Test Rust compilation
cd src-tauri && cargo check

# Test full Tauri build (requires system dependencies)
npm run tauri build -- --debug
```

## Expected Build Matrix

The CI now tests on:
- âœ… **Ubuntu Latest** - Uses webkit2gtk-4.1-dev with all build tools
- âœ… **Windows Latest** - Uses Tauri's automatic dependency handling  
- âœ… **macOS Latest** - Uses Tauri's automatic dependency handling

## Troubleshooting

### If builds still fail:

1. **Check the logs**: Use `./scripts/check-ci-status.sh` to get direct links to failed builds

2. **Run the monitor**: Use `./scripts/ci-monitor.sh` to automatically detect and fix issues

3. **Manual fixes**: Common issues and solutions:
   - **Missing dependencies**: Add them to the Ubuntu install step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - **Path issues**: Ensure all paths use the correct workspace structure (no `fuego-tauri` subdirectory)
   - **Rust issues**: Check `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` for dependency conflicts

### Prerequisites for monitoring scripts:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Git repository with proper remote configured
- Write access to the repository for auto-fixes

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the test build workflow to ensure all platforms build successfully
2. If any issues remain, the monitoring script will detect and fix them automatically
3. Once all builds are green, the main CI workflow will work reliably for all future commits

## Build Status

Current status: ðŸ”„ **Testing fixes** - Check `./scripts/check-ci-status.sh` for latest results
